INTRODUCTION
The Major ReOrg is a GEOS application which provides a combination directory organizer and GEOS file information editor.  MajReOrg will run on GEOS 64 or 128 v2.0 or higher.  It will also run on Wheels 64 and 128, as well as MP3 and gateWay.

STARTING OFF
    MajReOrg is executed by double-clicking on its icon from the deskTop.  The initial dialog that is presented allows the user to select the drive, disk, and directory or subdirectory that will be organized.  Use the Drive button to cycle through drives A, B, C, and D.  Use the Disk button to insert a new disk into a floppy drive, or (under Wheels) select a new partition or subdirectory.  Also on this dialog is a box which reads: "Use System Directory".  This option will default unselected, meaning that the main directory is has been selected to be organized.  If the option is selected, the "System Directory" under Wheels, which is the same as the "Border" area under GEOS, will be selected.

MAJREORG MAIN SCREEN
    After clicking the OK button, MajReOrg will open up the selected directory and present the main screen.  This main screen can be broken into several parts: the Existing Directory window on the left, the New Directory window on the right, the Exit box in the upper left hand corner, the Done button at the bottom, and the Function buttons running vertically between the two windows.  These buttons are, from top to bottom, the right arrow button, the left arrow button, the Spacer button, the right Flush button, and the left Flush button.

    The New and Existing Directory windows both have a set of arrow buttons running along the side of them.  Clicking the down arrow will show the next two pages of files.  Clicking the up arrow will show the previous two pages of files.  Clicking the farthest up arrow will show the first two pages of files, while clicking the farthest down arrow will show the last page or pages of files.

ORGANIZING DIRECTORIES
    To organize a new directory, all of the files from the Existing Directory window must be moved to the New Directory window, in the order which you would like them to appear on your disk or directory.  To do this, you must first select one or more files from the currently displayed page of files in the Existing Directory window.  Selecting files will highlight them, allowing you to either drag those files to the New Directory window, or use the right arrow button to move the files to the New Directory window.  Files moved to the New Directory window will always appear in the order in which they were moved.  Files in the New Directory window may also be selected and moved, using the single left arrow button, back to their old spot in the Existing Directory window.  You may have to use the up and down page arrow buttons to see the changes being made.

    The other three Function buttons not yet mentioned are the Spacer button, which has an "X" along with a right arrow, and the two Flush buttons, which have a pair of double right arrows.  The Spacer button will insert a blank file spacer into the New Directory window.  After clicking this button once, subsequent files moved into the directory will appear one space down from where you would expect.  Normally, new files in a directory always favor empty entries like these before being added to the end of a directory.  The right Flush button will move all remaining files in the Existing Directory window, in the order in which they appear there, into the New Directory window.  The left Flush button will clear the New Directory window and reset the Existing Directory window to its default state.

    After you have finished moving all of the files to the New Directory window, and they are ordered to your liking, you may click the Done button at the bottom of the screen.  The Done button will save your new file list onto the disk or directory, and return to the deskTop.  If all of the files have not yet been moved, you will receive an error dialog and be allowed to move the remaining files.

EXITING
    If you wish to exit MajReOrg before writing your new directory to the disk, select the Exit button in the upper right hand corner.  You will be prompted about saving your changes.  Selecting No will take you back to the deskTop without ANY directory organizer changes having been saved to the disk.  As mentioned below, changes which are Saved using the file editor are not discarded when exiting in this way.

FILE INFORMATION EDITOR
    MajReOrg, in addition to being a fine directory editor, also includes a file header editor.  To edit a file's information header, find its name in the Existing Directory window and double-click on the name.  This will bring up the File Information dialog.  When editing normal, non-GEOS files, this editor may be used to create a GEOS-style directory header.  Change only the Filename and DOS File Type fields on a non-GEOS file to avoid converting the file to GEOS. Please be very careful with this editor.  If you do not know what you are doing, don't mess with it!  If you would like to find out what you are doing, the GEOS Programmers Reference Guide is a good start.  Either way, when you are done making changes, you may click the Save button to immediately change the file and return to the MajReOrg main screen.  Clicking cancel will abandon any changes.

CLOSING
    The author of this program knows that MajReOrg has a stupid, punnish name, and does not require user feedback regarding this matter.  It was written during a weekend where on Friday I knew where I was on the corporate organization chart where I worked, but did not know where I would appear Monday, as the company bosses were completing the plans for yet another Major Reorganization.

    Anyways, this program is also a living testimony to the usefulness of geoBEAVER.  I highly recommend downloading it off my web site if you intend to do any GEOS programming.

    Lastly, special thanks to Dale Sidebottom for first pumping up my ego by telling me how great this program is, and then by helping to improve the program by suggesting the inclusion of the two Flush buttons.
